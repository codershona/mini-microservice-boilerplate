# Mini MicroService App


# Project Setup:
* React Install in ```client``` folder
* Node, express, axios and nodemon install ```npm install axios cors express nodemon``` as well as ```npm init -y``` in ```comments and posts``` folders.
# Implementation of Post Service Creation:

* For example, if we imagine we have a post service where 4 row and they are:

  * <b>Path</b> :
     * /posts
     * /posts

  * <b>Method</b> :
     * POST
     * GET 

  * <b>Body?</b> :

     * { title: string }
     * [ - ]

  * <b>Goal</b> :

     * Create a new post 
     * Retrieve all posts

# Testing the Posts Service:

 * We can test our post api by using Post Man API by running post and get ethod http which would created a post and by requesting get we will get all our posts which has been created.
