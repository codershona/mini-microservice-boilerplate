# Mini MicroService App


# Project Setup:
* React Install in ```client``` folder
* Node, express, axios and nodemon install ```npm install axios cors express nodemon``` as well as ```npm init -y``` in ```comments and posts``` folders.
* Always run ```npm start``` for frontend and backend to see in localhost:3000.

# Implementation of Post Service Creation:

* For example, if we imagine we have a post service where 4 row and they are:

  * <b>Path</b> :
     * /posts
     * /posts

  * <b>Method</b> :
     * POST
     * GET 

  * <b>Body?</b> :

     * { title: string }
     * [ - ]

  * <b>Goal</b> :

     * Create a new post 
     * Retrieve all posts

# Testing the Posts Service:

 * We can test our post api by using Post Man API by running post and get ethod http which would created a post and by requesting get we will get all our posts which has been created.

 # Implementation of Comments Service:

 * For example, if we imagine we have a comments service where 4 row and they are:

  * <b>Path</b> :
     * /posts/:id/comments
     * /posts/:id/comments

  * <b>Method</b> :
     * POST
     * GET 

  * <b>Body?</b> :

     * { content: string }
     * [ - ]

  * <b>Goal</b> :

     * Create a comment associated with the given post ID.
     * Retrieve all comments associated with the given post ID.

## Let's build our idea to post our comments:

   * <b>commentsByPostId:</b>
      * '35p5pj' ----> 
      * {id: 'j325', content: 'great post'}  ---> comment
      * {id: 'a5a5', content: 'neat!'}

      * { 'a5uha5' } ---> This is ID of a post ----> 
         * {id: '15ji', content: 'informative'}  
         * {id: '43iji', content: 'yes'}

         * BOTH ARE array of comments
# Quick Comments Service Test:

  * Now I had test API using Postman.
  * Check the request by using GET/POST Method Http

# React Project Setup:

  * React App:
      * <b>Posts Service:</b>
         * Router ----> Posts Feature

      * <b>Comments Service:</b>
         * Router ----> Comments Feature
      
      * App ----> 
         * PostList  
            * Comment List
            * Comment Create
         * PostCreate

      * Installation : axios
# Building Post Submission Method:

  * Added BootstrapCDN in index.html file and create the PostCreate file to build our logic.
  * Check Chrome devtools Network and check the XHR request when you try to submit any title on frontend by clicking the button.

# Handling CORS Errors:

  * Install npm install cors package in backend comments and posts folder.
  * Import cors into comments and posts index.js files.
  * Check again and Chrome devtools network and try to posts again if you see 201 status then posts has been created successfully.

# Fetching and Rendering Posts:
  
  * Check the PostList file which has been fetched and render into frontend.

# Creating Comments and Displaying Comments:

 * Check CommentCreate file and check your logic to post and see Chrome Devtools Network that its showing status 201.
 * To show your comments that you created check commentList file logic which display in our frontend.

 # Request Minimization Strategies:

  * GET /posts/ ----> post -----> GET/posts/:id/comments
  * Posts and Comments Feature(Posts Service + Comments Service)
  * Microservice Solution 1: Sync Communication
  * Microservice Solution 2: Async Communication
 # An Async Solution:

 * Microservice Solution 2: Async Communication(Application Behaviour: Event Broker and its goals it to receive notifications from different services. Take those notifications or those events and route them off to all the other services that we are running. That means in short, Receives events send them on to interested parties)

 * POST /posts ----> EventBroker ---> type: PostCreated ---> {id: 'a1343', title: 'new Post'}

 * POST /posts/:id/comments ----> EventBus ---> type: CommentCreated ---> {id: 'a1343', content: 'a comment', postId: '24dsaa'}

 # Common Questions Around Async Events:

  * Wait, so you are saying we need to create a new service every time we need to join some data?
    * <b>ANSWER:</b> Absolutely not! In reality, might not even have posts & comments in separate services in the 1st place.
   
   * Who cares that each service is independent?
     * <b>ANSWER:</b> Independent services + the reliability that brings is one of the core reasons of using microservices in the 1st place.

   * This is so over the top complicated for little benefit?
     * <b>ANSWER:</b> Seems that way now! Adding in some features starts to get really easy when use this architecture.

   * This system won't correctly in the following scenario.
     * <b>ANSWER:</b> There are some very special things we need to consider with this design. I have got solutions for most maybe? of the concerns you may have.

 # Event Bus Overview:
 
 * Many different implementations. RabbitMQ, Kafka, NATS...
 * Receives events, publishes them to listeners.
 * Many different subtle features that make async communication way easier or way harder.
 * We are going to build own event bus using Express. It will not implement the vast majority of features a normal bus has. 
 * Yes, for our next app we will use a production grade, open source event bus.
 * POST /events -----> POST to localhost:4000/events OR, POST to localhost:4001/events OR, POST to localhost:4002/events.

# A Basic Event Bus Implementation:

* Check the events folder and run npm init -y and install this packages: express, nodemon, axios, cors.Then create index.js file. 

# Emitting Event:

* Emitting means pass off/ send out/eject.
* Check posts index file and we added axios and async logic.
